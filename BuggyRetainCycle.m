In Objective-C, a tricky error can arise from the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods within a class.  If you don't carefully manage memory in your custom methods, you might unintentionally create retain cycles or premature releases, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior. For example, consider a class with a strong property referencing another object, and a custom `dealloc` method that doesn't properly release the object.  If that object also has a strong reference back to the original class, a retain cycle is created that prevents either object from being deallocated, resulting in memory leaks.
